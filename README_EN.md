### Working with the sensor
#### No addressing
In this mode, one sensor is connected to one pin of the MK; to work with it, it is not necessary to first read the address and write it to the program.
You can connect several sensors, specify your own pin for each, see the *one_pin_one_sensor* example.
```cpp
MicroDS18B20<pin1> sensor1;
MicroDS18B20<pin2> sensor2;
// ... etc
```

#### With addressing
In this mode, you can connect as many sensors as you like to one pin of the MK, but to work with them, you will need to enter unique sensor addresses into the program.
At the time of reading the address, only one sensor should be connected to the pin! An example is *address_read*.
For further work, the addresses are stored in arrays on the program side and transferred to the sensors during initialization, the pin is the same:
```cpp
uint8_t addr1[] = {0x28, 0xFF, 0xCD, 0x59, 0x51, 0x17, 0x4, 0xFE};
uint8_t addr2[] = {0x28, 0xFF, 0x36, 0x94, 0x65, 0x15, 0x2, 0x80};

MicroDS18B20<pin, addr1> sensor1;
MicroDS18B20<pin, addr2> sensor2;
// ... etc
```
Also, the address can be changed while the program is running, see the documentation above.

#### Read temperature
Reading the temperature is divided into two stages - requesting and receiving data. The request is made by the `requestTemp()` function. After receiving a request
the sensor starts measuring the temperature, which lasts from 90 to 750 ms depending on the configured accuracy *(by default, the accuracy is maximum,
conversion takes 750 ms)*. If you read the temperature before the end of the conversion, the sensor will return the result of the previous measurement,
so the examples use a 1 second delay or timer poll. You can get the temperature using `getTemp()` [float] or `getTempInt()` [int].
If the received data is corrupted or the sensor is missing from the linkII - the function will return the previous successfully read temperature value.
**Note:** on repeated calls `getTemp()` does not request a new temperature from the sensor (long function execution),
instead, it simply returns the previous result until a new `requestTemp()` request is made.

In version 3.5 of the library, it became possible to separately request the temperature and determine the correctness of the received data, so that only after that they can be read
and apply in the program - the `readTemp()` function. It also allows you to determine the connection status and whether everything is in order with the sensor.
To read the temperature, it is recommended to use a construction of the form:
```cpp
if (sensor.readTemp()) value = sensor.getTemp();
// else error handling
```
where `readTemp()` requests data from the sensor and returns `true` if it was read correctly. After that, you can get the current temperature from `getTemp()`,
which no longer requests the temperature from the sensor, but returns the result read in `readTemp()`.

#### We connect many sensors to one object
In version 3.9 of the library, it became possible to connect as many sensors as you like to one MicroDS18B20 object without creating an array of objects (as in older versions).
You need to create a two-dimensional array of addresses and transfer it to the library, also specifying the number of sensors on the line (the maximum is possible if it changes during the program).
This allows you to save some memory, but you can go further - put the array of sensor addresses in PROGMEM so that they do not hang in RAM.
Initialization in this case looks like this: `MicroDS18B20<pin, DS_ADDR_MODE, count>;` or `MicroDS18B20<pin, DS_ADDR_MODE, count, DS_PROGMEM>;` for PROGMEM mode.
Addresses are passed to `setAddress()`, and for polling, we simply pass the sensor index to the same functions as before. See the examples *async_read_many_bus*, *async_read_many_bus_pgm* and the documentation section *METHODS FOR SENSOR BUS*.

P.S. Instead of a 4.7k resistor, you can use two 10k in parallel =)

See **examples** for other examples!
## One sensor without addressing
```cpp
// one sensor is better to read without addressing, it saves a lot of memory
#include <microDS18B20.h>
MicroDS18B20<2> sensor;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // temperature request
  sensor.requestTemp();
  
  // use a millis() timer instead of delay, async_read example
  delay(1000);
  
  // check if the read was successful and output
  if (sensor.readTemp()) Serial.println(sensor.getTemp());
  else Serial.println("error");
}
```

## Multiple sensors without addressing
```cpp
// 2 or more sensors are UNFAVORABLE to use in this mode! But you can

#include <microDS18B20.h>
// Sensors on D2 and D3
MicroDS18B20<2> sensor1;
MicroDS18B20<3> sensor2;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // temperature request
  sensor1.requestTemp();
  sensor2.requestTemp();

  // use a millis() timer instead of delay, async_read example
  delay(1000);

  // FIRST SENSOR
  Serial.print("t1: ");
  
  // just display the temperature of the first sensor
  Serial.print(sensor1.getTemp());

  // SECOND SENSOR
  Serial.print(", t2: ");
  
  // check if the read was successful and output
  if (sensor2.readTemp()) Serial.println(sensor2.getTemp());
  else Serial.println("error");
}
```

## Read address
```cpp
#include <microDS18B20.h>

// only one sensor is connected to the pin!
MicroDS18B20 <2> sensor; // Create a thermometer without an address on pin D2
uint8_t address[8]; // Create an array for the address

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the address of the thermometer into the specified array
  if (sensor.readAddress(address)) { // if successful, output
    Serial print('{');
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
      Serial.print("0x");
      Serial.print(address[i], HEX); // Display address
      if (i < 7) Serial.print(", ");
    }
    Serial.println('}');

  }else Serial.println("Not connected");
  delay(1000);
}
```

## Several addressable sensors
```cpp
// 2 or more sensors are more profitable to use with addressing on one pin
#include <microDS18B20.h>
#define DS_PIN 2 // pin for thermometers

// Unique addresses of sensors - you can read in the address_read example
uint8_t s1_addr[] = {0x28, 0xFF, 0xCD, 0x59, 0x51, 0x17, 0x4, 0xFE};
uint8_t s2_addr[] = {0x28, 0xFF, 0x36, 0x94, 0x65, 0x15, 0x2, 0x80};

MicroDS18B20<DS_PIN, s1_addr> sensor1; // Create a thermometer with address
MicroDS18B20<DS_PIN, s2_addr> sensor2; // Create a thermometer with address

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // asynchronous reading of several sensors, see async_read_many example
  sensor1.requestTemp(); // Request temperature conversion
  sensor2.requestTemp();

  delay(1000); // expect result
  
  Serial.print("t1: ");
  if (sensor1.readTemp()) Serial.println(sensor1.getTemp());
  else Serial.println("error");

  Serial.print("t2: ");
  if (sensor2.readTemp()) Serial.println(sensor2.getTemp());
  else Serial.println("error");
}
```

## Asynchronous polling of a bunch of sensors
```cpp
// an example of a compact asynchronous polling of sensors on a software timer
// https://alexgyver.ru/lessons/time/

// number of sensors for convenience
#define DS_SENSOR_AMOUNT 5

// create a two-dimensional array with addresses
uint8_t addr[][8] = {
  {0x28, 0xFF, 0x78, 0x5B, 0x50, 0x17, 0x4, 0xCF},
  {0x28, 0xFF, 0x99, 0x80, 0x50, 0x17, 0x4, 0x4D},
  {0x28, 0xFF, 0x53, 0xE5, 0x50, 0x17, 0x4, 0xC3},
  {0x28, 0xFF, 0x42, 0x5A, 0x51, 0x17, 0x4, 0xD2},
  {0x28, 0xFF, 0xCD, 0x59, 0x51, 0x17, 0x4, 0xFE},
};

#include <microDS18B20.h>
// specify DS_ADDR_MODE to connect the address block
// and create an array of sensors on pin D2
MicroDS18B20<2, DS_ADDR_MODE> sensor[DS_SENSOR_AMOUNT];

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // set addresses
  for (int i = 0; i < DS_SENSOR_AMOUNT; i++) {
    sensor[i].setAddress(addr[i]);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // construction of a software timer for 1c
  static uint32_t tmr;
  if (millis() - tmr >= 1000) {
    tmr = millis();

    // output readings to the port
    for (int i = 0; i < DS_SENSOR_AMOUNT; i++) {
      Serial.print(sensor[i].getTemp());
      Serial print(',');
    }
    Serial.println();

    // request new
    for (int i = 0; i < DS_SENSOR_AMOUNT; i++) {
      sensor[i].requestTemp();
    }
  }
}
```

## Reading resolution of sensor
```cpp
#include <microDS18B20.h>

// only one sensor on line!
MicroDS18B20 <2> sensor;  // sensor on line 2 without address

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  uint8_t res = sensor.getResolution();  // reading resolution
  Serial.print("Resolution: ");
  Serial.println(res);  
}

void loop() {
}
```
